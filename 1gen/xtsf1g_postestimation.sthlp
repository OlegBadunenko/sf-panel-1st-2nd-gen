These statistics are available only in sample; by default {cmd:e(sample)} is used, which defines the estimation sample.

{title:Description for predict}

{pstd}
{cmd:predict} creates a new variable containing predictions such as
linear predictions, residuals, and estimates of technical efficiency.


{marker options_predict}{...}
{title:Options for predict}

{dlgtab:Main}

{phang}
{opt xb}, calculates the linear prediction.

{phang}
{opt resid:uals} calculates the residuals.

{phang}
{opt te_*} produces estimates of time-varying efficiency measures and confidence intervals.

{phang}
{opt u_*} produces estimates of time-varying inefficiency measures.

{marker examples}{...}
{title:Examples}

{pstd}Use the data only to show functionality, no theory behind the regression. Note how big the dataset is: N = 4698, sum of Ti = 28036.{p_end}
{phang2}{cmd:. webuse nlswork, clear}{p_end}

{pstd}Supose the wage frontier is determined by `job tenure, in years`, `total work experience`, and if worker is college graduate. Further, assume `age` explains the inefficiency heteroskedasticity function and `hours` explains the noise heteroskedasticity function; suppress intercept in the inefficiency heteroskedasticity function{p_end}
{phang2}{cmd:. xtsf1g ln_wage tenure ttl_exp collgrad, uilnvariance(age, nocons) vitlnvariance(hours)}{p_end}

{pstd}Estimate technical efficiency{p_end}

{phang2}{cmd:. predict efficiency_mode, te_jlms_mode}{p_end}
{phang2}{cmd:. predict efficiency_bc, te_bc}{p_end}

{pstd}The correlation is very high between them{p_end}
{phang2}{cmd:. correlate efficiency_*}{p_end}

{pstd}Estimate 95% confidence intervals, which is the default{p_end}
